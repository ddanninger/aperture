## Install

```
$ npm install aperture
```

*Requires macOS 10.10 or later.*


## Usage

```js
const delay = require('delay');
const aperture = require('aperture')();

const options = {
  fps: 30,
  cropArea: {
    x: 100,
    y: 100,
    width: 500,
    height: 500
  }
};

(async () => {
  await aperture.startRecording(options);
  await delay(3000);
  console.log(await aperture.stopRecording());
  //=> '/private/var/folders/3x/jf5977fn79jbglr7rk0tq4d00000gn/T/cdf4f7df426c97880f8c10a1600879f7.mp4'
})();
```

See [`example.js`](example.js) if you want to quickly try it out. *(The example requires Node.js 7+)*


## API

### aperture.getAudioSources()

Get a list of audio sources.

Example:

```js
[{
  id: 'AppleHDAEngineInput:1B,0,1,0:1',
  name: 'Built-in Microphone'
}]
```

### instance = aperture()

### instance.startRecording([options])

Returns a `Promise` for the path to the screen recording file.

Fullfills when the recording starts or rejects if the recording didn't start after 5 seconds.

### instance.stopRecording()

Returns a `Promise` for the path to the screen recording file.

#### options

##### fps

Type: `number`<br>
Default: `30`

Number of frames per seconds.

##### cropArea

Type: `Object` `string`<br>
Default: `'none'`

Record only an area of the screen. Accepts an object with `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` properties.

##### showCursor

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Show the cursor in the screen recording.

##### highlightClicks

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Highlight cursor clicks in the screen recording.

Enabling this will also enable the `showCursor` option.

##### displayId

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `main`

Display to record.

##### audioSourceId

Type: `Object` `string`<br>
Default: `'none'`

Audio source to include in the screen recording. Should be one of the `id`'s from `aperture.getAudioSources()`.


## Why

Aperture was built to fulfill the needs of [Kap](https://github.com/wulkano/kap), providing a JavaScript interface to the **best** available method for recording the screen. That's why it's currently a wrapper for a [Swift script](https://github.com/wulkano/aperture/blob/master/swift/aperture/main.swift) that records the screen using the [AVFoundation framework](https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/).

#### But you can use `ffmpeg -f avfoundation...`

Yes, we can, but the performance is terrible:

#### Recording the entire screen with `ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i 1 -y test.mp4`:

#### Recording the entire screen with `aperture`:

## Linux and Windows

We want to bring Aperture to Linux and Windows, but we don't have time or resources for such tasks (we're Mac users), so **any help is more than welcome**. We just want to enforce two things: **performance** and **quality** â€“ it doesn't matter how (`ffmpeg`, custom built native lib, etc) they are achieved.


## Upcoming

Aperture is in its early days. We're working on adding more features, such as *export to GIF*, compression options, support for multiple displays, support for audio, and much more. Check out our [Aperture](https://github.com/wulkano/kap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aaperture) issues on **Kap** to learn more.
